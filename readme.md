# blader
Playground for azure portal like blade controls made with angular.

### Notice
This sample is failling when loading the lazy blade component. 
In my opinion this is a bug in angular and I am waiting until they solve this issue or provide this feature ([see here](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/14324)).

As a workaround you can import the lazy module on the app module and all works fine but you will loose the lazy loading feature.
